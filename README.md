# Pacman-Search-Game
Implemented and analyzed different search strategies (UCS, A Star, Minimax, Expectimax etc) along with different heuristic functions to improve the efficiency of Pacman reaching its goal state.

BasicSearch.py is used to search for pacman goal state using generic search without heuristic like BFS, DFS, UCS and gerenic search with heuristic function like A star.

Using multiagent.py the search tree pruning techniques were applied to optimize Pacman's approach to reach success state by finishing all food without getting caught by ghosts.
Minimax, Alpha Beta Pruning and Expectimax techniques are used.
